Getting setup for MEES614  
========================================================
***

## Software & User Accounts


### R

We will use R for all coursework. Because being proficient in R programming is a prerequisite for registering for this course, you should not need to download and install the latest version of [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) for your system...unless you just bought a new computer.

### RStudio

RStudio is a powerful and productive user interface (IDE - Integrated Development Environment) for R that integrates coding, running scripts in R, plotting, help files, and Git versioning software (see next item). Download and install [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/). You want the free **desktop** version for your system.

### Git & GitHub

Git is a file version control system and GitHub is an online Git resource for coding-based projects. We will use GitHub to track different versions of our R scripts, turn in homework assignments, and share code. We'll install several Git-related items and follow multiple steps to setup Git and GitHub for use in this course:

1. Install Git. The software interfaces with RStudio (see below). Download and install [Git](http://git-scm.com/) for your system.
2. Setup RStudio to work with Git. In RStudio, under `Tools-Global Options`, click on `Git/SVN` at the bottom. You'll need to tell RStudio where to find Git (i.e., where it is installed on your system). This folder will differ from system to system, so you'll need to look closely. On a Mac it will probably be at `\usr\bin\git`. On Windows try: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\git.exe`.
3. Setup a [free GitHub account](https://github.com/join). Go [here](https://help.github.com/) if you have questions.
4. Download and install the GitHub GUI client for your system: [Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [Windows](https://windows.github.com/). This software will serve as an interface between Rstudio and the online version of GitHub, which in turn will allow you to share your work with me. 
5. Open the GitHub GUI. You be asked for your GitHub login credentials during setup. Your GitHub username and email should appear in the Configuration window - all edits to your code (or anyone else's) will be marked with these identifiers. 
6. Once setup is complete, create the following *repository* (place where you will store your files on your local computer and, eventually, on GitHub):
    + For group work that anyone can access, create a **public** GitHub repository. Click the `+` sign in the upper left and then `Create`. Name this repository `mees614-2015-lastname` using your name. **Note the path where your repositories will be saved and change this path if you want them somewhere else.** For example, you might instead save them to a folder named `code` or `MEES614`. To finish click `Create repository`. Lastly, click `Publish repository`, which will copy the repository to your GitHub account online. Go have a look at your GitHub account and confirm it is there.
    + Email me your GitHub username. I will create a second **private** repository that only you & I can see & where you will store homework and other assignments. This repository will be named `mees614-2015-UID`, replacing "UID" with your UID.
7. *Clone* your **private** repository to your personal computer. Click the `+` sign in the upper left and then `Clone`. Your private repository named `mees614-2015-UID` should be listed in the window. Click `Clone mees614-2015-UID` at the bottom to create a local copy on your machine.
8. On your local machine and within the newly cloned **private** repository (the one named `mees614-2015-UID`), create a folder named `hw00` (this is done in Explorer/Finder, not the GitHub GUI). You will need to create a new directory for each assignment (but one is enough for now). Note that because Git tracks *files*, you will not see any trace of your `hw00` folder on GitHub or in the GitHub GUI until you add some files to the folder.
 
### Stypi

We will use [Stypi](https://code.stypi.com) to facilitate live, collaborative coding. Please visit the [site](https://code.stypi.com) and create a user account. When you are done, email your Stypi username to me.
