Getting set up for MEES614 - Spatial & Landscape Ecology in R
========================================================
###=============================================================================

### R

As the name of the course implies, we will be using R for all coursework. Download and install the latest version of [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) for your platform. 

### RStudio

Download and install [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/). YOu want teh **desktop** version for your platform.

### Stypi

We will be using [Stypi](https://code.stypi.com) to facilitate live, collaborative coding. Please visit the [site](https://code.stypi.com) and create a user account. Next, [email](mfitzpatrick@al.umces.edu) the username to me. 

### GitHub

We will use GitHub to keep track our code and to turn in homework assignments, among other things. There are multiple steps for setting up your GitHub account for use in this course, as follows:

1. Setup a [GitHub Education account](https://education.github.com/). You'll want a **Student / Individual** account found by click on "Request a discount".
2. Create the following *repositories* (places where you will store your files).
  + For homework and other assignments that only I can see, create a **private** GitHub repository named `mees614-2015-UID-hw`, replacing "UID" with your UID.
      + Add me as a collaborator to your *private* repository.
        + [Matt Fitzpatrick: fitzLab-AL](https://github.com/fitzLab-AL)
  + For group work that anyone can access, create a **public** GitHub repository named `mees614-2015-lastname-firstname` using your name.

### R Markdown

Nothing to install here as access to R Markdown comes with RStudio. 



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
